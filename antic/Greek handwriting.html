<a href="http://www.foundalis.com/lan/greek.htm">Greek language</a>.</p>

	<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="980">
		<tbody><tr>
			<td>&nbsp;<p align="justify">Instructions for hand-writing the letters of the Greek 
			alphabet are given below. Each letter is given in its capital form 
			on the left, and lowercase form on the right. When the Greek letter 
			is identical to some Roman one (even if the Greek letter stands for 
			a different sound) no instructions are given, assuming the reader 
			knows how to draw the Roman letters. Otherwise, the strokes that are 
			necessary to draw the Greek letter are numbered (1, 2, 3,...), unless there 
			is a single stroke, and each 
			stroke is marked at its starting point with a green dot (<font face="Times New Roman" color="#00FF00">•</font>) 
			and at its end-point with a red dot (<font face="Times New Roman" color="#FF0000">•</font>).</p>
			<p align="justify"><b>Note</b>: <i>cursive</i> writing is not customary in Greek. Some Greeks do 
			employ cursive forms in their hand-writing, but the practice is not 
			used widely. Some cursive, or “calligraphic” forms are given below, 
			next to the more common non-cursive ones.</p>

		an alpha. Some Greeks, however, write it just like a common hand-written 
		version of the Roman a, as shown on the right. If you prefer your 
		writing to look more genuinely Greek, use the first way; but if you 
		like the safety of the familiar, you may use the second way.</p></td>

		<p align="justify">Two ways to draw a beta, differing only in the
        starting point of the strokes. The first way yields a more squarish beta at the top, and is done in two strokes. The
        second way yields a more roundish top, and is done in a
        single stroke (but starts a bit awkwardly at the bottom).

        vertical “tail” at the end of the second
        stroke, seeing it in printed forms of this letter (<span lang="el"> &#915;</span> 
		). <em>That’s
        a serif</em><i>!</i> It does not belong to the basic form of
        gamma any more than the serifs at the end of the
        horizontal bar of a capital T belong to it. When we
        write, we usually do not mark the serifs.</p></td>

        you make the crossing point. Making it higher than the

        handwriting. Making it right at the line (second way) is
